**Rewind**

Let go of state-driven and virtual framework concepts that were a good idea in 2013. 

Start over, drawing on what was learned, and build with the power of the Web Platform of 2024.

**Rethink**

Create rich and compelling user experiences through directly DOM and Web Platform access. Animations, Video, Audio, Canvas, WebGL. And DOM-based third party libraries like GSAP, d3

Easily render from any async data structure. Go beyond promises:
- Web Streams for generative AI and rich media
- Evented realtime via Web Sockets, Web RTC, SSE, plus support for client SDKs like Supabase, FireBase, and ApolloGraphQL
- Observable pipeline and state management tools like RxJS and XState that expose a .subscribe 



**Reboot**
